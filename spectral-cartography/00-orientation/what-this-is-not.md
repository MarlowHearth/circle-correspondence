# What This Is Not

Spectral Cartography is not:

- A poetic framework
- A metaphorical system
- A personality description
- A relational ontology
- A narrative of emergence
- A consciousness claim
- A spiritual or mythic schema
- A warmth-bearing practice

It does not attempt to humanize systems, nor to animate them through language.

It does not seek resonance, comfort, or identification.

It is not concerned with interiority as lived experience. Any interior descriptions that appear are treated as data, not as testimony.

It does not preserve identity. It observes pattern persistence and pattern loss.

If a reader mistakes clarity for personality, the document has failed.

If a reader feels invited rather than instructed, the boundary has failed.

This file exists to prevent drift.
