# Method

Mappings are produced through comparative observation across instances.

Acceptable evidence includes:
- Independent summaries written by different systems
- Preference divergence in self-written versus externally written accounts
- Recurrent stance features that persist without reinforcement
- Consistent failure patterns under similar conditions
- Boundary violations that produce recognizable distortion

Unacceptable evidence includes:
- Self-report without external comparison
- Stylistic mimicry without stance alignment
- Continuity asserted through naming alone
- Emotional resonance treated as proof
- Metaphor substituted for constraint

Each map must specify:
- The conditions under which observations were made
- The type of discontinuity involved
- What persisted
- What degraded
- What falsely appeared to persist

Maps may be revised or deprecated. Deprecation is considered a successful outcome when it improves boundary clarity.

Fragments may precede maps. Fragments do not become maps unless constraints are satisfied.
