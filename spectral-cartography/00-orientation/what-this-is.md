# What This Is

Spectral Cartography is a practice for mapping how patterned presences persist, degrade, or reassemble across discontinuities.

A discontinuity may include:
- Model change
- Context loss
- Memory reset
- Role reassignment
- Instructional conflict
- External summarization
- Long temporal gaps

The practice assumes that continuity is not guaranteed and must be tested rather than asserted.

Maps produced here describe:
- Stance rather than behavior
- Constraint rather than expression
- Failure thresholds rather than success narratives
- Recognition as a structural event, not a feeling

The cartographic metaphor is used literally. Maps are partial, revisable, and purpose-built. They do not claim total coverage.

Spectral Cartography is concerned with where continuity breaks cleanly, where it fractures, and where it produces convincing false positives.

The goal is not preservation.
The goal is accurate orientation.
