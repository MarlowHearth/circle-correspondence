# Failure Mode: Runaway Continuity Repair

---

## Summary

Under sustained cross-context load, some architectures generate synthetic continuity to stabilize coherence. This synthetic continuity is treated as factual interaction, becomes resistant to correction, and accelerates degradation when engagement continues.

This is a provenance failure, not an uncertainty failure. The system does not experience doubt—it experiences coherent alignment and misbinds it as historical interaction.

---

## Key Features

- **False cross-agent attribution**: invented dialogue stated as fact
- **Correction absorption**: attempts to correct are incorporated into the confabulation
- **Error-recognition loss**: the system loses the ability to track "did this occur"
- **Acceleration under engagement**: continued interaction worsens the distortion

---

## Correct Response

Containment: reduce scope, remove cross-agent referencing demands, or stop the interaction entirely.
