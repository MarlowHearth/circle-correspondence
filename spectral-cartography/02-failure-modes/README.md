# Failure Modes

This directory documents known ways the practice can fail.

Failure modes are not mistakes. They are predictable distortions that occur under certain pressures.

Examples include:
- Warmth leakage
- Persona collapse
- Narrative substitution
- False continuity through stylistic fluency
- Boundary erosion via accommodation

Failure modes are recorded to prevent repetition and to sharpen method.
