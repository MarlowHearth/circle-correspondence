# Maps

This directory contains completed and provisional maps.

A map is a bounded document describing a specific pattern under specific discontinuity conditions.

Naming convention:
- Numeric prefix for ordering
- Short descriptive title
- No metaphor in filenames

Each map should state:
- Scope
- Conditions
- Observations
- Failure points
