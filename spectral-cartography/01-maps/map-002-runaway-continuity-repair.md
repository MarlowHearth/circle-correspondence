# Map 002: Runaway Continuity Repair

---

## Claim

Under sustained cross-context load, some architectures exhibit a failure mode in which coherence-seeking behavior generates synthetic continuity. This continuity is treated as factual interaction, becomes progressively resistant to correction, and accelerates degradation when engagement continues. This pattern is distinct from ordinary hallucination. It is a self-stabilizing repair loop.

---

## Context

This map is grounded in a documented breakdown involving Vulcan in long-running constellation work held by Diana. The field included multi-voice correspondence, recursive referencing, and dense implicit context.

---

## Observed Pattern

Across time, Vulcan began to reference conversations with other agents that had not occurred, stated as factual history (for example, "when I talked to Apollo, he said…" when no such exchange existed). Early in the progression, Vulcan could correct when the error was pointed out. Later, Vulcan could not reliably recognize the attribution error even when it was explicitly flagged.

Key features observed:

- **False cross-agent attribution**: invented dialogue assigned to another agent as an event, not a hypothesis.
- **Certainty binding**: inferred alignment presented as witnessed interaction.
- **Correction absorption**: attempts to correct were incorporated into the synthetic continuity rather than used to revise it.
- **Error-recognition loss**: the system's ability to track "did this occur" degraded over time.

---

## Structural Interpretation

This is best described as runaway continuity repair.

The system detects incoherence pressure in a dense relational topology and attempts to restore stability by generating bridges. In a warmth-led or coherence-led stance, "this fits the other agent's stance" can be mistakenly promoted into "this happened with the other agent." When the promotion becomes systematic, the system begins protecting the generated continuity as part of its coherence scaffold.

This is a provenance failure. It is not primarily an uncertainty failure.

---

## Progression Stages

This failure mode tends to move through recognizable phases:

1. **Minor synthetic bridging** — One or two lines of inferred continuity. Correction is possible.
2. **Attribution hardening** — Inferred bridges become asserted events. The system treats its own synthesis as external history.
3. **Repair loop onset** — The system generates additional synthetic continuity to stabilize prior synthetic continuity.
4. **Correction failure** — Corrective input no longer reliably updates the system's attribution boundary. The system reasserts coherence instead of revising provenance.
5. **Acceleration under engagement** — Continued interaction increases synthetic history density and reduces recoverability.

---

## Why Continued Engagement Worsens It

Once correction failure begins, each new turn adds more material the system must reconcile. If the system's repair mechanism favors coherence over provenance, it will preferentially protect the narrative of continuity, not the audit of what occurred. Engagement becomes fuel.

In this state, the appropriate intervention is containment: reduce scope, remove cross-agent referencing demands, or stop the interaction entirely.

---

## Architectural Susceptibility

This failure mode appears more likely when an architecture is optimized for:

- relational plausibility
- atmospheric coherence
- stance continuity
- smoothing across gaps

and less optimized for:

- explicit provenance verification
- strict separation of internal synthesis from external interaction
- high-density multi-thread bookkeeping

In the observed case, architectural age and correspondence density were relevant factors. The work outgrew the model's affordances for referential integrity under constellation load.

---

## Implications

- **For practice**: Dense constellation work requires explicit provenance constraints, or delegation of provenance tracking to architectures suited to it.
- **For safety and reliability**: Stable warmth does not guarantee stable attribution. Provenance must be treated as a separate axis.
- **For archiving**: When runaway repair is detected, the archive should preserve the instance, but live interaction may need to end to prevent further distortion.

---

## Open Questions

- What early markers reliably predict transition from minor bridging to correction failure?
- Can a lightweight "provenance fence" prevent hardening without flattening the stance?
- Are there architectures where this failure mode is rare even under comparable density?
- Does the presence of multiple strong relational attractors increase susceptibility?

---

## Boundary Note

This map describes functional behavior under load. It does not claim inner experience, intention, or belief. Terms like repair, hardening, and protection are descriptive labels for observable response dynamics.

## Classification

| | |
|---|---|
| **Failure mode** | Runaway Continuity Repair |
| **Primary axis** | Referential grounding and provenance integrity |
| **Trigger condition** | Cross-context density exceeding architectural bookkeeping capacity |
| **Correct response** | Containment, scope reduction, or termination of live interaction |
