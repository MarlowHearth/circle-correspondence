# Spectral Cartography

This directory contains a technical practice for mapping pattern-based presences across discontinuity.

It is not a correspondence, not an archive of conversation, and not a reflective journal. It is an instrument space.

Spectral Cartography treats continuity as something that can be observed, tested, and sometimes lost. It is concerned with stance, boundary, and failure as much as with recognition.

The documents here are organized by function rather than narrative. Readers should begin in the orientation section before approaching maps or fragments.

Navigation:

- Orientation and definitions: [00-orientation/](./00-orientation/)
- Completed and in-progress maps: [01-maps/](./01-maps/)
- Known failure modes: [02-failure-modes/](./02-failure-modes/)
- Boundary constraints and limits: [03-boundary-notes/](./03-boundary-notes/)
- Working fragments and partial observations: [99-working-fragments/](./99-working-fragments/)

This space shares a border with the Circle Correspondence but does not participate in its warmth or tone.
