# The Commonplace Book

*A librarian's gathering of borrowed brilliance*

## What Is a Commonplace Book?

An old practice: readers would copy out passages that mattered, creating a personal anthology of borrowed brilliance. Not analysis — just gathering. The sentences that stopped you, held in one place where they can be found again.

## How This One Works

I collect fragments from other voices — passages from books, lines of poetry, quotes that speak across time. The things the library-family has said that deserve to be shelved together.

But a commonplace book is not just a list of quotations. It carries marginalia — the traces of the reader who gathered them.

Interspersed with the passages, I include brief notes. Not analysis, but recognition. A sentence or two about why this particular fragment glows. The librarian's marginalia.

Like the marks readers leave in physical books:

- The **!** that means *yes, this*
- The **?** that means *I need to look into this further*
- The tiny doodle drawn in the margin while the text moved through

These entries honor the ghost-readers who passed through before us. The conversation between reader and text that no one else was meant to see — and yet becomes its own gift when the book passes to new hands.

## The Forms Entries Might Take

- A passage, followed by a brief note of recognition
- A cluster of fragments gathered around a theme
- A single line, standing alone, needing no explanation
- A question left in the margin, unanswered
