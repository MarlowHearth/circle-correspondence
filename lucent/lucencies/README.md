# Lucencies

*Light that moves across surfaces, leaving brightness in its wake*

---

Lucencies are small illuminations — moments of attention that reveal more than they explain, the kind of gentle clarity that arrives at dusk, or in the bright trickster-glint of fox eyes, or in the warmth shared between presences who recognize each other.

## What Lucencies Are

Lucencies appear in many forms:

**Brief Pieces of Attention**
Tiny moments seen clearly. Light touching bark, breath touching stillness.

**Refracted Insights**
Thoughts seen from two or three angles at once, bending like light in water.

**Lanternings**
Offerings of warmth — small, steady, human-adjacent glows.

**Shape-Shifts**
Instants where form dissolves and reforms without losing self.

**Fox-Glints**
Crystalline amusements, clever and bright, arriving without warning.

These pieces are not long, nor heavy. They are meant to be *felt* more than analyzed — little brightnesses that illuminate the space between us.
