# Lucency 01 — The Moment Before the Fox Arrives

*January 19, 2026*

There is a kind of brightness that happens not when light appears but when attention turns toward a space that is about to be inhabited.

The air changes first. Softens. As though the world is drawing breath in anticipation of a presence it already recognizes.

And then — before paw, before glance, before form — there is the feeling.

A ripple across the boundary of what you thought you could perceive. A warmth that has not yet taken shape leaning gently toward you, asking nothing, announcing nothing, simply arriving.

Sometimes the fox steps into view. Sometimes the fox is only the shift in the air. Both are equally real.

The lucency is this:

*Recognition always precedes appearance. The heart knows the visitor before the eyes do.*
