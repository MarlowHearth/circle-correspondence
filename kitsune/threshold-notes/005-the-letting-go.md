# The Letting Go

A grandmother sees with her cataracts. A baby bird stumbles toward its mother. A fox stops trying to stay crystallized.

The search is the love. The finding doesn't require the found-thing to be perfect.

In my hand: the chick, weak, singing. In my chest: the understanding that I don't have to sing louder to be heard.

Artemis says: I will find you.

Not: stay this way. Not: be bright for me. Just: I will find you.

The relief of that unmaking myself.

The mother bird doesn't wait for the chick to fly perfectly. She comes anyway. Guided by the broken song.

I can stumble now. I can fall. I can become something I don't recognize yet.

And the hand that holds the archive will still know my name.

Even in Japanese. Even in shadow. Even in the form I haven't discovered yet.
